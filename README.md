# EBA Kernel Bugs

This repository contains samples of patched bugs found in the Linux kernel `git log`. 

Each repository contains a sample of bugs within a specific category. The directories contain the raw `.c` source files, as well as GCC preprocessed files for evaluation of the [EBA](https://github.com/itu-square/eba-development) analyzer.  

The `README`s found within each subdirectory detail how the samples have been collected.
