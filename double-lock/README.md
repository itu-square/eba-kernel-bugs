# Double lock kernel bugs

A benchmark of _C Single-Thread Double Lock_ bugs (originally added by Iago Abal in [IagoAbal/2017-vmcai](https://github.com/IagoAbal/2017-vmcai)).

All the files come from patches to the Linux kernel found in the `git log` of the kernel repository at [https://github.com/torvalds/linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux).

The two folders contain:
- `preprocessed`: Fully preprocessed files.
- `raw`: Raw un-preprocessed source files.
